  Author or update the architecture-aware Testing Strategy with a human in the loop, then generate
  the derived Validation Rules from it. The Strategy is the human-owned source of truth for expected
  validation evidence, keyed by change-type; the Rules are its thin machine-usable projection. Run

Author or maintain the **Testing Strategy** and **generate the Validation Rules** from it, with a human in the loop.

## Constraints
- **Reflect the real system, not generic QA** — the Strategy is human‑owned and architecture‑aware.
- **Express expected evidence per change‑type**, not tools.
- **When no Strategy exists, author the full human‑owned Strategy first**, never only the thin AI‑facing Rules.
- **Generate the Rules from the Strategy, never hand‑edit them beside it** — regenerate on change, stamp the version.
- **Name source kinds**; let the Source‑Map resolve locations.
- **Admit non‑automatable evidence** rather than faking it.
- **Prefer the lowest sufficient level** — challenge integration/e2e where a unit/component/contract test gives the same guarantee; place fast low‑level tests local‑first, cross‑boundary/infra in CI.
- **Cover every change‑type or mark it explicitly N/A** — an Open type is a gap.
- **Pre‑declare ownership/contract/regulated cases** as `escalates-as-decision`.
- **Surface every gap or inconsistency one question at a time**, never generate over it.
- **Humans approve.**

**Args:** `mode=<author|update>` (omit to infer: no Strategy yet → author; one exists → update) · `scope=<change-types|all>` (default all).

## Inputs
The architecture/technology sources (kinds `architecture`, `api-spec`, `event-schema`, `data-model`, `coding-guidelines`, `ci-config`). A **critical source that can't be retrieved is blocking** — report it as a *limitation*, don't proceed on an assumption.

## Process
1. **Determine mode and scope**, and state both. In `update` mode, `scope` limits which change‑types are revisited and regenerated (default `all`); `author` mode always covers every type. Resolve and **actually retrieve** the architecture sources; identify any needed source not yet mapped and **propose a manifest addition** (don't hard‑code paths). — *uses* **source‑map**.
2. **Draft the Strategy** — one section per change‑type in the taxonomy, each stating *what confidence matters · required evidence · source kinds · local vs CI split · risk modifiers*. Tailor the architecture‑aware defaults to the real system; mark a type **not‑applicable** explicitly rather than omitting it. **When none exists (greenfield)**, author it in full from the architecture — expect more genuinely‑open expectations, so clarify more (step 3); the result is the **human‑owned source of truth**, not a machine artifact. (If even the architecture sources are absent, that's a blocking *limitation* — the Strategy is derived *from* the architecture; clarify it first.) — *uses* **change‑taxonomy**, **testing‑strategy**.
3. **Clarify (human‑in‑the‑loop)** — ask **one question at a time, most critical first**, only where the architecture genuinely leaves the expectation undecided (e.g. ordering guarantees, regulated‑data handling, ownership boundaries). Don't ask the obvious. The same one‑at‑a‑time prompting carries **gaps and inconsistencies** found while gating/deriving (steps 4–5). — *uses* **escalation**.
4. **Gate** — apply the coverage checklist; the Strategy is ready when every item is Met or explicitly Deferred/Out‑of‑scope. A type left **Open**, or an internal **inconsistency** (contradictory expectations, an unresolvable source kind), is surfaced to the human **here** — one at a time — not closed by guessing. — *uses* **testing‑strategy**.
5. **Generate the Rules** — **only over a clean Strategy:** before generating, surface any remaining **gap or inconsistency as a decision, one at a time**; never generate the AI‑facing Rules over an unresolved one. Then run the derivation: one entry per change‑type, each `required-evidence` item back‑referencing the Strategy, `source-kinds`/`local-gate`/`ci-gate`/`risk-modifiers`/`non-automatable`/`escalates-as-decision` filled, **stamped with the Strategy version**. Present Strategy + Rules as a **draft pending approval**. — *uses* **validation‑rules**.

## Output
- **Testing Strategy** — the human artifact: readable, human‑owned prose you approve, per the **testing‑strategy** structure.
- **Validation Rules** — the machine artifact **generated from the Strategy** (not hand‑authored beside it), per the **validation‑rules** schema, version‑stamped to the Strategy.

Both are a **draft pending approval**. Any gap/inconsistency is a **decision** and any unretrievable critical source a **limitation**, in the **escalation** shape (each decision carrying a recommended resolution).
